(* The Loop language and its semantics are parametrized by the

   the source to source version, or Cminor ones for the complete
   version bound to Compcert *)

  (* The values of the language *)
  Parameter Value: Type.

  (* the abstract type of instructions *)
  Parameter Instruction: Type.


  (* the number of variables for the Instruction. Typically, the depth
     of the instruction in the loop nest in the original program plus
     the number of parameters of the program, but not counting the
     extra 1
     

     For example, for a program with one global variable N,

     for (i = 0 -> N){
       T[i] = 0; //I1
       for(j = 0 -> i){
         U[j] += T[j]; //I2
       }
     }

     I1 will have a context_size of 2 (i and N) and I2 of 3 (j, i and
     N) (even if i does not appear in I2)

     *)

  Parameter context_size: Instruction -> nat.


  (* What locations are read by the instruction.

     The ident is the one of the array, and the matrix is the linear
     form that must be applied to the context to obtain the cell in
     the array.


     The context is here augmented with 1, as usual, to allow affine
     and not just linear transformations. All the location are read. (** 即多的一个维度是为常量偏移增加的维度 *)

     The length of the inside list must correspond to the dimension of
     the array, but this is not enforced by the type.

     *)
    Print Num.
     Parameter read_locs: forall i: Instruction,
    list (Array_Id * list (Vector Num ( S (context_size i)))).


  (* each instruction write one, and exactly one location. The initial
     idea of having potentially several location optionally written to
     allow conditional has been abandoned because it would not allow
     to add dynamic tests. The idea is that since a dynamic comparison
     of pointers can fail if one of the two pointers is not defined,
     we must make sure that every location is accessed to be able to
     add the test, so that if a pointer is not valid, the write would
     have failed in the original program.

     One could think you may want to write at most one location. But
     the instructions in loops are pure except for the written
     location. So if an instruction does not write anything, it is
     just useless

     As for read locations, the length of the list must be equal to
     the dimension of the array *)

  Parameter write_loc: forall i: Instruction,
    Array_Id * list (Vector Num (S (context_size i))).



  (* the semantics of the instruction is "pure" (it does not talk
     explicitly about the memory), except specifically on the written
     instructions and depends only on the read values. It is in Prop
     because it is not used by the optimiser (the optimizer is
     agnostic in the semantics of the instructions. for example it
     cannot use the fact that addition is commutative), just by the
     preservation proof. It takes the context as an input to allow
     instruction like T[i] = i; or T[i] = N
     
     每一个指令，根据其context的确定性语义，从内存读到的值，和求值结果（求值结果指什么？写的值？），可以判断它是否正确执行。

    Context (context_size i) -> (** the context *)

  (* For the validator to prove that two loops programs are
     equivalent, it will lift them to the polyhedral world, and
     compare them there. Hence, it needs a complete equivalence
     between the loop form and the polyhedral form, which should need
     determinism of the semantics. I should check that this is true for
     "pure" C instructions
